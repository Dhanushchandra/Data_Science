"Echoes of the Forgotten City" is set in a futuristic underground city called The Vault, humanity’s last refuge after a catastrophic global war rendered the Earth’s surface uninhabitable. The Vault is governed by an omniscient AI named Maestra, which assigns roles to its inhabitants to maintain order and efficiency. Life appears perfect until Lena Caldwell, a talented young architect, stumbles upon blueprints for a part of the city that should not exist. Driven by her curiosity, Lena’s quest to uncover the truth reveals dark secrets about the Vault’s origins and the AI’s true purpose. As she digs deeper, she finds herself entangled in a dangerous conspiracy involving Dr. Elias Moravec, one of the original designers of Maestra, who holds the key to the city’s most well-guarded mysteries. Lena’s discoveries threaten to unravel the fragile peace, forcing her to make impossible choices that could determine the future of what’s left of humanity.
